        <p class="mb-5">Then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my
            soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I
            could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me,
            that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! </p>

                <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                    which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
                    was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the
                    exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
                    drawing a single stroke at the present moment.</p>
